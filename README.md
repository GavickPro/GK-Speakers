GK-Speakers
===========

Plugin for creating custom taxonomies in our WordPress themes

## Important!

Please don't install the Github-generated ZIP packages directly on your WordPress!

Github adds additional directory to the final ZIP file, and it can cause problems on your WordPress installation with other plugins (WordPress don't search inside the deeper directories from the package for plugins).

There are two ways to install the GK Speakers plugin:

* create own zip from the downloaded ZIP package - please extract from the downloaded ZIP file the gk-speakers directory and then pack it into new ZIP package which can be uploaded in the WordPress back-end
* upload via FTP the gk-speakers package directly to wp-content/plugins directory in your WordPress installation.
